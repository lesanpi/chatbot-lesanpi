Good-bye, Chef!
	Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!
 
What? All right! Yeah! 
	Oh, finally! 
 
Nnono!
	Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
 
That's right.
	Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?
 
Thank you. Jimbo.
	Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
 
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
	Yeah.
 
Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 
	What's this? 
 
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
	A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
 
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
	You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
 
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
	I know it's not a real ticket!!
 
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
	The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
 
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth!
	And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
 
Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-
	There, like that! Stop that!
 
Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? 
	I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
 
Thanks!
	At least we're smart enough to know better!
 
Soo, that's it people.  When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.
	Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
 
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
	Yeah. Good going, stupid!
 
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 
	Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!
 
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
	Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
 
Turning right at O two four niner. 
	That's it. That's that the last one.
 
No...
	I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
 
So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
	Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
 
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
	You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
 
Yeah!
	I'm...  I'm not ready...
 
It's simply asking too much.
	Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
 
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 
	STAAAN!!
 
What?? What??
	Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!
 
Whats going on dad?
	JUST GET THE GUN!! 
 
JUST GET THE GUN!! 
	Unh, come on! 
 
Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
	A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 
 
Sso?
	SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
 
Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
	Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
 
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
	Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
 
So what happens now?
	We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.
 
It's okay! 
	We're alive?? We're alive! 
 
Oh thank God.
	Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
 
Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.
	FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
 
People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!
	Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
 
No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. 
	I like the sand idea.
 
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
	It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
 
Yeah.
	All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.
 
Dad, this is stupid.
	Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 
 
I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker.   I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the "real" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?
	Uhh, Stan?
 
Hello.
	It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
 
Be safe. 
	Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
 
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
	ManBearPig?
 
He could be half bear, half manpig.
	Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
 
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
	Stan?  Stan?
 
H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.
	Stan!
 
What?!
	You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
 
I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
	...I'm not a r-tard. 
 
Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?
	Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
 
Is that a computer game?
	No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  "Hello."  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 
 
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. 
	What?? Why?? Why?!
 
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!
	Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 
 
Dad??
	Yeah, I'm playing from the office.
 
Everyone target scorpions.
	Yes?
 
We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.
	That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.
 
Where is he?!
	Who are you?
 
Unless they have this sword,  your son's character is going to die!
	Nn-Oh my God! 
 
We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
	Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!
 
Stupid?
	Where?!
 
I don't know.
	Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
 
No, I have a life. 
	Give me the sword.
 
You?
	I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
 
We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!
	Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 
 
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 
	Where's your car?
 
We took a cab here!
	Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
 
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
	World of Warcraft! I need to play!
 
Our demo is set up right over by the- 
	Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! 
 
I've gotta heal. 
	Staaan! 
 
Dad? Not now!
	Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
 
Dad, how did you get that?!
	No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
 
Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
	Okay. 
 
I got it! 
	Augh!
 
Dad!
	Stan... 
 
Dad? Dad?
	Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
 
I know you do, Dad.
	Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
 
No, I'm not saying they're related!
	How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 
 
Oofff.
	Godspeed.
 
Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. 
	What's goin' on?
 
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
	With a student? But... she's a woman.
 
Yeah. I know.
	But... she's hot.
 
Poor woman. She's a victim.
	Yeah, she's a hot victim. 
 
Dad! Dad!
	What?
 
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
	Biggie Smalls?
 
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
	All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
 
How do you know??
	I'm a geologist! 
 
Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss-  What the? No! No!
	...Smalls.  No way!
 
Motherfucking God-damnit!
	That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!
 
Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
	Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
 
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
	Oh, well that's good.
 
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
	...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
 
I'm not playing, I'm coaching.
	Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
 
What are you talking about?
	Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
 
I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
	Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
 
I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. 
	What are we goin' to do, Sharon??
 
What?
	Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
 
Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
	Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
 
Ohhhh!
	Stan?? Shoot it! 
 
You got it, Stan!
	Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!
 
Randy, what's wrong??
	OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
 
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
	Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
 
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
	Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!"  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 
 
Yeah! We did it! We did it! 
	NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! 
 
All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!
	Thanks, Pat!
 
You've got some family here watching tonight. 
	Yeah, they're all rooting for me.
 
And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
	Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
 
Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is  People Who Annoy You.
	Okay. 
 
As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E.  We just need three more consonants, and a vowel.
	Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
 
And a vowel?
	An O please.
 
Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here.  The category is People Who Annoy You.  Audience, keep quiet, please. 
	Uh... Well, uh...
 
Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.
	I know it but I don't think I should say it.
 
Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
	Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...
 
Oooo. 
	Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right.
 
Uhh, can we cut to a... Can we cut to a- 
	Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
 
I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
	What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
 
Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
	I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
 
The puzzle you were solving was "people who annoy you".
	Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?
 
Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.
	Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.
 
Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
	Y-Yes, absolutely.
 
Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. 
	Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.
 
Kiss it.
	Huh?
 
Apologize. Kiss it.
	You want me to kiss your-
 
That's right.  Apologize.
	Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...
 
Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the "nigger" guy.  Say, "Hi, 'nigger' guy!"
	Hi, "nigger" guy! 
 
That's all right, "nigger" guy. You know we're just playin'. 
	Yeah... No problem...
 
Hey. What do you think you're doing? 
	I just... need some aspirin.
 
You aren't welcome in this store, "nigger" guy.
	Fine! 
 
Aaaaaaa!
	Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say "Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy."  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! "Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just "Nigger Guy".  Respect. 
 
You can't get to me! Words are like bullets!
	And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "nigger" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "nigger guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 
 
Is this "nigger" guy serious?
	Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 
 
Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! 
	Awww! Awwww! 
 
Wooo! 
	Whoa! 
 
Where you goin' "nigger" guy?
	Please I, I don't want any trouble.
 
You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!
	What do you want?
 
Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.
	What's going on here?
 
We're all just like you.
	No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
 
I made a mistake too.  I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.
	You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
 
You really think that matters?!  You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damned "nigger" guy!  Oh, you don't like that, do ya?
	No.
 
Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
	Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "nigger guy".
 
"Nigger guy"?
	Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
 
Yeah! That's right!
	Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
 
Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
	Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "nigger guys"? 
 
The motion is passed! 
	We did it!
 
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
	...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
 
...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
	Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 
 
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
	Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!
 
Right, so, why do we color eggs? 
	Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
 
Yeah, but why?
	Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
 
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
	That's right.
 
You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
	Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!
 
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
	What is wrong with him?!
 
Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 
	You know so little! 
 
Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?
	Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! 
 
Dad! You've gotta help me! 
	Hang on, I'm taking a crap.
 
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
	What?
 
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
	We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.
 
Randy?
	Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
 
Ohhh.
	Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
 
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
	I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
 
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
	We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
 
Does Mom know about this?
	Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
 
I don't understand!
	I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
 
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
	Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
 
So what is the secret of Easter?
	I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
 
I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
	I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
 
Grandpa's in it too?
	Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
 
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
	You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
 
You mean the old Galveston Lodge? 
	Dammit.
 
Yeah.
	Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
 
They're everywhere! 
	Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
 
Where am I supposed to go?
	Just get out of here! 
 
Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
	Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.
 
My legs. I... I think they're broken.
	Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
 
Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 
	You...
 
You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
	You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
 
Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
	It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
 
The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
	I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
 
You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! 
	No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
 
Ya see? 
	Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
 
We swear it, on the cross.
	Just hand over the bunny, Stan!
 
Okay, fine. 
	Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
 
You said "hand over the bunny."
	No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
 
Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! 
	Oh, we should've seen that coming!
 
My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! 
	No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.
 
Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.
	Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
 
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
	That's my boy.
 
Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.
	Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
 
All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!
	You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.
 
Spare some change?
	No, sorry, I don't have any change.
 
Got any change?
	No, sorry. 
 
Chaaange?
	Huh! I don't have any change. 
 
Change?
	No!
 
Spare some change?
	Leave me alone I don't have any change!
 
All right, God bless you, sir.
	Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.
 
Spare some change?
	I just gave you change!
 
Change? 
	Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 
 
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
	Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!
 
Randy? Randy, what happened?
	Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
 
South Park has become overrun with the homeless.  Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible.  Many people are trapped throughout the town. 
	Help! Help us!
 
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
	No sign of anybody else.
 
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
	Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
 
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
	You won't make it through, Gerald! 
 
What happened?
	He's become one of them.
 
Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. 
	We don't have any change! Go away!
 
Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.
	Find another place to hide, Steve!
 
You have to let them in, Randy.
	There isn't enough food for more people up here!
 
This isn't happening!
	All right all right, fine! 
 
Could you spare some change, sir?
	Harrrh!
 
Sorry to take the easy way out.  OW! OH, FUCK! OWW!  OHHH! AH! GOD! 
	No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
 
No. We can't be.
	Face it, we're gonna starve!
 
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
	Those are cherry! Ich!
 
What? You do?
	How? Call the fire department.
 
Randy, what are you doing?
	He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
 
I'm not like them.
	Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
 
And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
	If we have to! Siddown Glen!
 
Randy, you can't just-
	SIT... doowwwnnnn!
 
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
	A bus! A bus is coming!
 
Yeah.
	Look, Glen. We're saved. 
 
Why are they turning?
	What are they doing?  Don't leave us!
 
We're gonna be all right!
	Oh Glen! We made it!
 
Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. 
	Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
 
Well, what food have you been eating?
	P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff.
 
I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.
	How painful is "painful"?
 
How painful is "painful"?
	Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
 
What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!
	Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
 
Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!
	Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 
 
Randy!
	Look what your old man made.
 
No way!
	Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
 
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 
	I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
 
Why?!
	Well he's gotta see this.
 
No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
	No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
 
Oh, for the love of God, Randy! 
	Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
 
Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
	Hey guys!
 
Are you feelin' better?
	Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
 
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
	Well I don't know about ever...
 
Well I don't know about ever...
	I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
 
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
	I guess it was pretty big.
 
Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 
	It wasn't bigger than mine was.
 
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 
	Mine... mine was bigger.
 
I doubt it. 
	You wanna see it?
 
That did not seriously come out of your ass.
	Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
 
Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!
	That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 
 
Randy Marsh!
	Aw crap!
 
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
	The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
 
Guinness World Records America. How can I help you?  The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir.  Because we don't want to.  Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification.  You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich.  You're welcome.  Jeez, another one.  Guinness World Records America.
	Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
 
What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?
	Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
 
I believe I detect some cabbage as well?
	Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
 
You have got to be kidding me.
	These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 
 
Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics
	Courics...
 
The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.
	But that means...
 
That's right. You are the new world's champion!
	Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 
 
We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken. 
	Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
 
Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
	I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
 
Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.
	You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
 
Come on guys, lasagna's ready.
	Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
 
What are you talking about?
	You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
 
Randy, this is ridiculous!
	Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
 
But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
	Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
 
Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
	What?
 
Hey. Hey that's right.
	Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
 
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
	Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
 
Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!
	I would need a lot of help.
 
Come on, Randy, what do you say?!
	I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
 
Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first. 
	Oooooo.
 
That's great, Randy!
	Can I, can I see it?
 
Sure. This is your colon, a-and here...  is the feces growing inside your belly. 
	Ahhh...
 
Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
	In Zurich?
 
Yes.
	I can't do it! I can't do it!
 
The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!
	But then, does it still count?
 
I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.
	No... Nooo...
 
There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
	I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? 
 
What?!
	I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
 
Have I?!  Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!
	Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 
 
Dad, are you all right?
	Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.
 
Stan, you guys are good! 
	Sharon, what are the boys doing?
 
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
	They can play guitar now?
 
No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
	Ohhh.
 
If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
	Hey yeah...
 
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
	So you boys like this music, huh?
 
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
	Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
 
Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!
	I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
 
Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.
	But... But this is real.
 
Dude, we are total rock stars now!
	You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
 
Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
	No way!
 
All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
	Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.
 
Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
	Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.
 
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
	I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
 
You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! 
	NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
 
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
	This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
 
Yeah, but we totally don't.
	Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
 
Man...
	Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?
 
Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground , and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. 
	She's such a train wreck!
 
Aw, poor girl.
	Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. 
 
Sacrificed? For what?
	For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
 
Corn harvest!
	We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
 
She's dead.
	Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 
 
Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? 
	An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
 
Hey, check it out! 
	Looks like next harvest will be even better. 
 
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
	Let's hear it for Gerald!
 
And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
	And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
 
Randy, off the Internet.
	Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
 
No, mister, it's time for night-night.
	But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
 
You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 
	One more thing?  Ooooyeah... 
 
What the hell?
	Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 
 
What?
	My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
 
My Internet's not working either.
	What?! 
 
Dad, the Internet's not working!
	I know that, okay?!
 
Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
	Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
 
Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
	Gerald. Please help us.
 
Randy. What happened?
	Our house... It has no Internet.
 
Oh my God.
	We've got nothing! It's just gone.
 
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
	Thank you Gerald. 
 
I'm getting on it first.
	Oh no you're not!
 
Ih it's not working.
	What?!
 
No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
	It's not working, Gerald.
 
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
	Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!
 
What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
	Right, Starbucks!
 
Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?
	No! Nobody's is!
 
Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
	Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
 
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 
	God, the whole neighborhood's affected. 
 
It's not working here?
	Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
 
No, don't. You're wasting your time.
	How do you know?!
 
Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
	Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
 
What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
	A television! 
 
Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
	Jesus, it's statewide.
 
No Internet... anywhere...
	Jesus... we're all alone... 
 
What's the matter?
	I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 
 
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 
	Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!
 
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
	You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
 
Randy, where will you go?
	We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
 
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
	Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
 
It could come back.
	Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.
 
Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?
	How. You won't have Internet. 
 
Sorry folks, we're full up.
	Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
 
You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee.  It's about a mile down the road.
	I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 
 
Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
	Sure will be nice. 
 
You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
	That's right. We need to get online.
 
Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there?  Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead.  Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... 
	Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. 
 
Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
	Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
 
Name?
	Do they have Internet here?
 
Name?
	Marsh.
 
Service provider?
	NetZero.
 
All right, stay in line.  Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.
	So is there Internet here?
 
Stay in line and get to your campsite. 
	Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
 
Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
	Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
 
Next? Brady, John H.
	Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 
 
What did you say?
	Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
 
Next? Nelson, Peter T.
	Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
 
Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
	I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
 
So jack off.
	You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
 
What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
	Three minutes would be plenty.
 
Get lost! 
	Ohhh.
 
Psst. Hey! Over here!  You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?
	Yeah, how'd you know?
 
Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.
	I know, right?
 
Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say "click".
	"Internet Porn Simulator" 
 
Give it a try. 
	Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.
 
Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.
	Well at least that part's like the Internet.
 
Gggggyyaaah! 
	Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 
 
Un. Choukawaii yo ne! 
	Oh niice... Whoa... 
 
Watashi wa... daisuki! 
	Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
 
Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
	Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
 
Get the keys! We gotta get in there. 
	Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! 
 
Randy!
	Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
 
You son of a bitch!
	Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 
 
We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
	And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 
 
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
	All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 
 
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
	There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
 
Turn it off, Dad!
	Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
 
Oh Jesus Christ! 
	Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
 
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained! 
	There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
 
The news.
	Huh?
 
We're watching the news.
	That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 
 
None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
	Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
 
This is ridiculous!
	Ohhh this is good!
 
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
	Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
 
I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 
	What the hell was that? 
 
Oh my God.
	Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! 
 
What's going on, Dad? 
	Get back to your room, Shelly! 
 
Get back to your room, Shelly! 
	What's going on?
 
They're all over the place!
	What are?!
 
They're really furry! 
	What did that?!  What is that thing?! 
 
AAAAAAAAH!! 
	Oh my Gohhhd!
 
Go go go go back the other way! 
	Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.
 
Oh my Gohhhd! 
	HAAA! 
 
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 
	Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!
 
Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared. 
	I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.
 
Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
	I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
 
Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.
	Jesus, this thing is worldwide? 
 
Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 
	Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
 
Go Randy, run! 
	Gotta get out!
 
Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people. 
	Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
 
Where do we go, Randy?
	We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 
 
Geow, my arm! MY ARM! 
	Oh Jesus!
 
Randy, run! 
	Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
 
Dad! 
	In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
 
Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 
	Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 
 
Randy? Where are you going? 
	Here we see a view from outside the bus.
 
Randy!  What the hell are you doing?
	I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
 
Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!
	All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
 
What is that? Chris, what is that?
	That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 
 
Get off the roof! 
	Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 
 
And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.
	Oh no! Oho oho. 
 
It stung me! It stung me! 
	Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
 
Am I in charge or not?! 
	We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
 
Guinea rats?
	I'm so startled.
 
In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
	Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?
 
Travis! No!
	You can't help him!
 
It's a guinea bear!
	No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! 
 
Mom, I can't see.
	It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 
 
What what what what?
	Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! 
 
Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
	It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.
 
What is that? What is that? 
	I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
 
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
	What is it?
 
Oh my Gohhhd!
	Oh no, I'm way too startled!
 
Look! 
	Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
 
Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
	Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 
 
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.
	Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
 
If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. 
	Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
 
It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.
	Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
 
Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him "Sparkles".
	He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
 
Yes we can!
	Yes I can! Yes I can! 
 
Yes I can! Yes I can! 
	Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 
 
Everything is going to be awesome now!
	This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
 
I don't even know what to do now.
	I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!
 
Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... 
	WOOOO Obama!
 
Obama yeah, I can't believe it!
	O ba ma! O ba ma!
 
O ba ma! O ba ma!
	Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama! 
 
Obama!
	Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
 
Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!
	BOOOO! 
 
Come on, time to go home.
	What are you? A McCain voter?
 
Yeah!
	Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 
 
Obama! Obama!
	Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
 
Jesus Christ...
	O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
 
Yehhheheah!
	Wooo, change.
 
Dad Dad, we have a problem.
	Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
 
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
	We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
 
Dude, he's wasted.
	Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! 
 
Oh, hello Marsh.
	Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! 
 
Huh?
	You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
 
Dad, what are you doing?!
	It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
 
Hey, I voted for Obama.
	Obama's not talkin' about you!
 
So where's the other doctor? 
	Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 
 
No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.
	Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
 
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
	Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
 
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
	Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
 
Okay, next please.
	Go on, Stanley. 
 
Dad?!
	Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
 
All right everyone, eat up. 
	Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
 
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
	I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 
 
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
	There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
 
This is the first guy to actually make sense. 
	Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
 
Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 
	We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
 
What should we do, Randy?!
	We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 
 
You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.
	I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
 
We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
	Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
 
Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!
	What?!
 
Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
	Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
 
By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!
	We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
 
Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!
	That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
 
Why would someone do this? 
	What is this? What's going on?
 
There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
	What's he doing?
 
Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.
	But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
 
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 
	Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
 
For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn.  Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases. 
	Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! 
 
Butters?
	Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 
 
Why? What happened?
	A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 
 
...So?
	Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
 
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
	I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
 
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
	Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
 
We're here to find out why?!
	The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 
 
Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 
	What does that have to do with anything? 
 
I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately.  It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this...  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes,  and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just...  shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip.  See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.
	What was that?
 
Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 
	Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
 
Mom, gross! 
	Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
 
Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
	Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!
 
Stop it, Mom!
	Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
 
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
	Sharon! Marsh!
 
Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. 
	That's it, I'm leaving! 
 
Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
	That's completely different!
 
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
	Heh, yeah?
 
But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
	Yeah?
 
And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 
	Come on Stanley, let's go. 
 
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
	It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 
 
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
	I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the "Don't be scared"  and of course there's the-
 
Sick! Stop it, lady!
	Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 
 
AWWW!
	Jesus Christ!
 
Phillip! 
	Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
 
No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!
	Alright son! Yeah!!
 
What's going on?
	HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
 
Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
	Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
 
Mom, we didn't mean... 
	Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 
 
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
	Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
 
Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
	There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
 
Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that youre proud.
	You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
 
(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (dead fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish.
	Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 
 
Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.
	We know!
 
Well it's way past time for bed.
	Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
 
Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
	That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
 
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
	Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.
 
What is that?
	It's, uh it's nothing, really.
 
All right!
	Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."
 
Tells?
	When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
 
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
	Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 
 
Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hearby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?
	Yes I do, yes I do.
 
Alright you man, good luck today. 
	Oh! Yes! 
 
Well well, look son, it's the Marshes.
	Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
 
No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet. Think they're saving the best for last.  Clocked her in at home at 1.5 seconds. It's the fastest car we've ever built.
	One point five?
 
Huh, only fitting our boys should be going head to head for their match, hey Marsh? Heh. 
	Come on, Stan, you can do this! 
 
You got it Emmett! 
	Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!
 
We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
	Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
 
Dad they aren't here for that.
	Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.
 
Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life.
	What?  Hey, hey Sharon.
 
NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here,
	So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
 
What? Oh my God.
	Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
 
Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. 
	Hullo?
 
Prease say herro froma China.
	Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 
 
I seek the life forms that made this. 
	That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
 
Oh yeah?  You're gonna build me another one, see?
	He's got a gun!
 
Who wants it next, huh?!  Anyone else on this planet wanna be a hero? 
	What do you want?
 
Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?
	Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.
 
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.
	Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
 
Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.
	We're working on it! 
 
Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
	Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.
 
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
	Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
 
Alright, that does it! 
	Hello?
 
Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!
	Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
 
Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
	Awhuh. 
 
Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police.
	What?! 
 
'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
	Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.
 
Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?
	Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
 
Uh we've seen nothing here in France.
	Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
 
He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
	No, we're sure.
 
So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
	That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
 
You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
	...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
 
If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
	We will give you a call!
 
I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. 
	Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
 
I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?! 
	Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
 
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
	No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
 
Kill the alien?
	Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
 
What are you two whispering about, riiight?
	Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
 
Dad? 
	Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
 
Alright men, check the ship. 
	You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
 
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
	But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
 
Can you believe it?
	Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. 
 
Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
	Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?
 
Huh?
	Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
 
Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
	Will you relax, Stan? 
 
Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!
	Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
 
Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
	Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.
 
Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
	Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
 
And so, did you find the missing space cash?
	Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
 
Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?
	Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
 
No.
	Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
 
Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
	Probably.
 
Well you folks all take care now.  Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.
	Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
 
Uh huh. Have a good day. 
	Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
 
Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
	No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
 
Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!
	Nobody can build anything!!
 
Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!
	Wha?! Finland?! 
 
We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.
	Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
 
I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.
	Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
 
Very well. 
	All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
 
Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys? 
	Oh dammit!
 
Oh dammit!
	Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
 
Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
	Whaa-wha-what about it
 
It appears to have been... destroyed.
	Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.
 
Oh no, not Finland.
	Hey guys, Finland's dead.
 
All of Finland, gone.
	Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
 
None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
	No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
 
We didn't say anything about nukes.
	Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.
 
What?
	Stan?
 
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
	Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
 
Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
	Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
 
No changes.
	Yeah, no, we've told you everything.
 
All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. 
	Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!
 
These are not space cops.  There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?
	It was... a trick?
 
Needless to say, you all failed.  People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye. 
	No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!
 
Wow cool.
	Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?
 
I would like to-
	MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
 
AAAAAAAA!
	Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
 
Dad, why did they do that?
	Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 
 
Teikara chickens!
	Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
 
Piss off, you stupid assholes! 
	Isn't this great food?
 
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
	You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-
 
As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning... 
	Fags! 
 
Come on boys, you can do it! 
	Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 
 
We're here! It's the water park! 
	I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
 
I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. 
	What's going on?
 
I told you people to keep civilians back!
	Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
 
It was almost all pee, no H.
	Oh my God. I've gotta help him! 
 
Stay back!
	You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
 
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
	It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
 
What is all pee?
	Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
 
What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
	I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
 
Randy, you've got to do something!
	Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
 
Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.
	I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 
 
You sure you want to do this?
	Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
 
He looks agitated...
	Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.
 
He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! 
	No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
 
Hey look! 
	Stan! 
 
Are you fucking kidding me?! 
	Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
 
We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities.  However, we are still collecting data, and all-
	Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
 
We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell. 
	Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 
 
Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
	Read what?
 
This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
	So?
 
Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!
	Huh?
 
I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
	"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!
 
Nono, just keep reading.
	"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- 
 
I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
	Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!
 
Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
	"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.
 
Well?
	It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
 
Right? It's not just me.
	No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
 
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
	NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
 
That's right.
	Butters? Is that true?
 
Yeah, we wrote that!
	Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
 
Hey it looks different.
	Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?
 
So where's the KFC now?
	Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 
 
Can I help you sir?
	Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
 
Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
	Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
 
Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
	Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
 
Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
	My huh?
 
Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
	Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 
 
What'd they say?
	KFC's gone, been replaced.
 
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
	Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 
 
The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.
	I gotta get to the doctor! 
 
Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.
	All right!
 
Yep, you check out fine.
	That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
 
For what?
	Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
 
Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.
	But you said I'm totally healthy!
 
Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!
	...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
 
Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
	Yeah, but what's the quickest way?
 
The what?
	Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
 
Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
	Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 
 
NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
	"Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright.  "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."  "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit.  "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?

	Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!
 
Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.
	SCORE! 
 
Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-
	Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
 
Your prescription for what?
	Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
 
Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
	One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
 
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
	Uh that is nice! That is nice!
 
Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!
	I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
 
No, I mean, your actual balls!
	Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 
 
Excellent.
	Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
 
Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.
	Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
 
Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
	No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
 
Yeah.
	Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.
 
Women love huge balls?
	Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
 
Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? 
	See?
 
I'm stoned off my balls! 
	Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
 
Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
	I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
 
Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 
	Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?
 
Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
	Hey. My eyes are up here.
 
I'm sorry, I just...
	It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
 
It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
	Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
 
I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
	Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
 
Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
	Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
 
Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
	What do we want?
 
Bigger doors!
	Where do we want them?
 
Weed stores!
	What do we want?
 
Bigger doors!
	Where do we want them?
 
And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. 
	Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 
 
Yeah. Great.
	Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
 
Randy, I love it! 
	And when it gets cold it shrinks. 
 
Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! 
	Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
 
Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.
	Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
 
No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
	...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?
 
...Dad, you are my friend.
	...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
 
Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
	Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
 
I just wanna do my homework!
	Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
 
Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
	Oh cool! Okay. 
 
"Edit profile. Basic... settings" Jesus Christ!
	Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
 
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
	Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
 
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
	That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 
 
Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! 
	Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
 
...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
	Stan, poke your grandma!
 
No. Can't be.
	Yahtzee!
 
Awgh!  Oh thank God.
	Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
 
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
	Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
 
I have no idea...
	You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
 
Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!
	Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
 
Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
	Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
 
That's nice!  I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer! 
	Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
 
WHAT?
	We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
 
I am an actor. I do not pack fudge! 
	Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 
 
Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.
	ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
 
It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-
	Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
 
Ooooooo...
	That's... tricky...
 
Well then you can just get sued! 
	Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
 
No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!
	Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
 
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
	Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
 
Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!
	Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
 
I don't know.
	Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
 
No, you could still see his eyes...
	Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 
 
God, will somebody shut her up?
	Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 
 
What?!
	Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 
 
Muhammad, are you okay? 
	What the hell was that?!
 
We made a promise... to Jesus! 
	Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 
 
That'll be Tom Cruise... 
	Helllo?
 
Yeah, so whats going on?
	Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
 
What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!
	There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
 
Gingers? Aww, hell no.
	Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
 
You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?
	Well, yeah.
 
Keep... your hand... UP!
	Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
 
All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
	Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
 
Three!
	Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 
 
Aw crap.
	Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
 
How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!
	Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
 
We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!
	We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
 
So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?
	I don't really work out.
 
Sheila?
	People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 
 
Jesus! Why are they doing this?
	More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
 
Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!
	Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
 
We are very sorry, but California cannot afford helping you at this time.
	Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
 
No, because Utah is between Colorado and California.
	Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
 
Nevada.
	Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
 
That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
	Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
 
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
	There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
 
What are you talking about?
	We could ask Al Qaeda.
 
Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
	Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
 
Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bad quick! There's trouble!
	People from Jersey?
 
It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! 
	What is it?
 
It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. 
	That thing is famous? Why?
 
Snooki.
	Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 
 
Istagia makuman? 
	Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 
 
He's still questioning that new prisoner.
	Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
 
Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. 
	What does that mean?!
 
You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. 
	Stop playing stupid!
 
Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.
	Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!
 
Is it them, Randy?
	Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
 
Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
	This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
 
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
	Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
 
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
	Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
 
Who is that?! 
	It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
 
It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
	On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 
 
It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
	On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 
 
Tango is down, tango is down.
	We got him!
 
I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is.  It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.
	Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
 
Oh Jesus.
	What does that mean?
 
It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.
	What?!
 
I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.
	Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
 
Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.
	What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
 
Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.
	That does it! 
 
What are you doing?!
	I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
 
Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!
	Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
 
It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!
	I said get me in there!
 
Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine!  You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.
	Ahhh.
 
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
	Stan?  Stan!
 
Dad? Is that you?
	Yes, it's me, Stan.
 
Where are you?
	It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!
 
The hell are you doing, dad?
	I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
 
Did you come here to help me?
	I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!
 
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
	Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
 
DAD!
	Aah ahhh aha ahhh.
 
Ahhh, you're back, everyone! 
	Aw, dammit. 
 
All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. 
	Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
 
Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
	It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
 
Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
	I mean, hello!
 
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
	Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 
 
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. 
	What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
 
Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
	I don't know.
 
Well take it down. It's noisy.
	I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 
 
All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?
	Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
 
Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.
	Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
 
Alright, come to bed soon.
	Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.
 
Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor.
	Mmm, God damn. Yeah.
 
See how that just falls off the bone?  Mmm, that is MONEY right there!
	Yeah, it's fuckin' money.
 
Hey y'all. Tonight we're gonna be makin' some deep-fried chicken.
	Aw yeah?
 
Muh buttery whipped potatoes and we're gonna be finishin' off with a chocolate pecan pie.
	Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah. 
 
Dad, what are you doing?
	Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
 
Aw crap. 
	Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crme frache.  Aw yeah... Awwww...
 
Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
	No!
 
Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
	Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
 
Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
	Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. 
 
Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.
	Aw yeah, look at that.
 
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
	I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
 
We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.
	Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.
 
Now let's get that on the grill.
	See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
 
Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for.
	Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
 
Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout?
	Aww, stupid commercials.
 
Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted.
	Come on!
 
Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray. 
	Bohh-riiing.
 
Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.
	Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.
 
Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- 
	Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?
 
Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
	I wasn't watching food channels!
 
Then how do you know I blocked them?
	I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
 
Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say "crme frache."
	Crme frache.
 
Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?
	Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
 
I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
	Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
 
Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.
	Yeah?
 
Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
	You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
 
Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
	If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
 
I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. 
	Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
 
I was thinking about shallots, actually.
	Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
 
Randy! Marsh!
	WAH! Sharon!
 
Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
	Hello there, children!
 
Awww what?!
	How's it goin'? 
 
No, dad! No!
	The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
 
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
	I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crme frache.
 
Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
	Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
 
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
	Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
 
You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger.  Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five.  Faster. Harder.
	Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Frache.
 
La lalala la la...
	Aww, fuck yeah. 
 
Lalalalala la, frache, frache.
	Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... 
 
Frache. 
	Frache.
 
Cafeteria Frache.
	Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
 
Can we have some food, please? 
	Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it frache.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
 
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
	Quiet on set, please.
 
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
	Back from where?
 
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
	Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
 
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
	Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
 
What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
	Yes chef!
 
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
	No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
 
Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?
	Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
 
I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
	Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!
 
Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy.  Why, why won't people listen to me?
	Jamie Oliver!
 
Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!
	Behind you!
 
And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
	Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!
 
The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
	Crme frache. Crme frache.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crme frache?!  Where did I leave that fucking crme frache?! It has to be somewhere!
 
Randy, I'm back.
	Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crme frache??
 
Randy, we should talk.
	I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
 
Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
	You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
 
What'd you say?
	I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
 
Can I try something?
	Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.
 
You gonna go back to the kitchen?
	Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
 
No, I'm good, thanks. 
	I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 
 
Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
	Oh dear.
 
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
	Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 
 
Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
	I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
 
I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
	Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
 
They have sex?
	Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
 
Oh, that's cool.
	And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
 
What's a penis?
	...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
 
Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
	Four point four inches...
 
Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
	Seven centimeters...
 
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
	Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 
 
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually  Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width- 
	Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE 
 
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.
	Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
 
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?
	You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
 
Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!
	Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
 
Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?
	No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
 
If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give-  whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!
	Yeeaahh!
 
Yeah!
	Yeeaahh! 
 
Alrighty, let's see what kind of-
	Burn it down! 
 
Burn it down, dude! 
	Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 
 
Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
	This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
 
What exactly are you angry about?
	We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
 
The Jews!
	Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
 
You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
	Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
 
Yeeaahh!
	And we want-
 
And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate!
	Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
 
And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh.
	Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
 
No, and fuck Kyle!
	Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
 
Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
	No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!
 
Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.
	Rrrr!
 
However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change.  The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches.  Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered "above average". 
	The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
 
Wait, what?
	America is back!
America is back!
 
Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
	We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
 
I'm still fucking angry!
	Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
 
Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
	Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
 
Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
	Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
 
Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
	Tween Wave?
 
You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
	Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
 
This is different!
	...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
 
It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
	"Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."
 
Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 
	I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
 
Well, it sounds like crap, right?!
	Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.
 
Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
	No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
 
Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
	It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 
 
We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
	Ugh, that's so unfair!
 
But that's our music! We like it!
	Yeah it's good!
 
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
	Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
 
Yuck!
	What?
 
Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
	Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
 
Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
	No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 
 
Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
	That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
 
It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
	Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
 
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
	Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 
 
You suck!
	No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
 
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
	City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 
 
I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
	City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
 
Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. 
	Yoyoyo! 
 
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
	You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
 
Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
	I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
 
... You're 42 years old, Randy!
	I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
 
You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 
	Why can't you ever just support me?!
 
Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
	Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
 
WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
	Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
 
Come on britches, we're settin' you free.
	I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
 
I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
	You kind of seem shitty to me too.
 
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's Syndrome from school vaccinations  has put the government in a tight spot.  At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.
	It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
 
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
	Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
 
What?
	We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
 
You've heard of Mexican salsa, but Mexican pride? The phenomenon is called "Orgullo de Mantequilla," where Mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the US. The borders are being flooded with Latin Americans trying to get back to their own countries. 
	Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!
 
Yup, he's devastated.
	I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
 
I didn't see the game.
	You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
 
Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
	A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
 
Niice. 
	What?
 
Forty-five minutes non-stop.
	Nuh uh.
 
It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
	Noh uh.
 
I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
	Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
 
Wicked.
	Oh. Wicked.
 
...Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe, she was just wicked people
Head to toe...
She wasn't good, to know what goodness is...
	Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
 
Nono, I'm good, thanks.
	Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
 
Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
	Can I get a scotch and soda? 
 
Enjoying the show?
	Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
 
No?
	To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
 
Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."
	Subliminal messages?
 
Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 
	Whoa, no way!
 
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
	You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
 
How long was it?
	She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
 
Nice, bro!
	Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.
 
What was the show about?
	Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
 
Go! Go! 
	Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
 
Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!
	Really??
 
Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker.
	Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
 
What?? Randy, are you serious??
	I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
 
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
	Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
 
Man time!
	Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
 
Sounds like a dream, bro.
	It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
 
Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
	Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
 
Huh?
	Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
 
Mr. Randy Marsh?
	And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.
 
It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
	Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!
 
Sup bro?
	Not much, sup with you guys?
 
We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
	Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
 
Musicals are about subtext!
	My musical has lots of subtext.
 
"A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work."
	And then she does. It's a metaphor.
 
Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
	Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
 
You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!
	Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 
 
Randy! Randy, brah!
	Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
 
Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down.
	Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
 
Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him.
	Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
 
Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!
	I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
 
Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
	Whassup brah?!
 
What brah?!
	Sup brah?!
 
Take a swing, brah!
	Right here, brah! 
 
Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!
	What makes you the brauthority brah?!
 
West Side Story, brah!
	What brah?!
 
Sweeney Todd, brah!
	What brah?! What brah?!
 
Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!
	I do respect you, bro!
 
Show some respect, bro!
	I do respect you, bro!
 
Then stop disrespectin', bro!
	I respect you, bro!
 
Okay, I respect you too!
	Okay! 
 
Party people!
	Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
 
You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical.
	Hey, really??
 
How about instead of "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" we call it... "The Woman In White"
	Oh, that is beautiful!
 
And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
	Bro'dwaaay!
 
Woohoo!
	Ooof. 
 
Hey hun.
	Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.
 
Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
	Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
 
Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
	Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
 
Of course not, go ahead, hun.
	Alright babe.
 
I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
	Okay. What's Shelly doing?
 
I gave her those tickets to "Wicked."  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
	She's WHAT?!
 
Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
	OH!  Shelly! Hold on! 
 
Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!
	AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!
 
Why does it matter?!
	She's too young for that stuff!
 
Too young?!
	This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
 
That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
	I can't!
 
WHY?!
	Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
 
That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
	D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?
 
Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-
	And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?
 
Oh my gosh.
	Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
 
Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
	No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
 
It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!
	AAAA!
 
AAAA!
	Shelly! 
 
No one cares about wicked people.
Now she's gone but we don't care.
And are we gonna live in peace, and all live free, you'll see.
O Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe-
	Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!
 
Dad, what are you doing here?
	Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
 
Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
	Oh you fucking pervert!
 
Alright, get the hell out of here, you! 
	Shelly! 
 
Randy!  Randy, what are you doing?!
	It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
 
Hey, it's Spider-Man
	Sorry! Sorry.
 
Sorry! Sorry.
	Agh! 
 
The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater.  The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver. 
	Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
 
Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
	It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
 
I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
	Really?
 
Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
	Oh Sharon, you're the best. 
 
So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
 
Wow, that's weird.
	Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer.
 
If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.
	Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
 
The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
	Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
 
Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
	I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 
 
The law is the law sir.  You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. 
	Yeah thanks.  Asshole.
 
You say something?
	No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
 
Shoes off. Belts off.
	Yeah yeah.
 
I just need to check your asshole.
	So ridiculous.
 
Asshole clear.
	Thanks.
 
Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can...
	Hey, what's that thing? 
 
That's a camera. It's a security camera.
	Aw, you people have me on camera now?
 
Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?
	Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
 
But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.
	Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 
 
Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy.
	What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
 
And the toilet seat was up.
	We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
 
That's right.
	Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
 
Yeah.
	It is time for us all to grow up.
 
That's right.
	It is time for a sue-ance.
 
Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross.
	Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
 
Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole? 
	That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
 
Clyde, you there? Hello? 
	Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
 
What?! Randy!
	Just trying to leave without being rude.
 
That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
	Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
 
Six thousand dollars.
	Six thousand?!
 
It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
	Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
 
Artonius Jackson catches the ball , he's running down the sideline-  Ohhhh!
	BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
 
Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up. 
	That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
 
And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
	All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
 
We don't have kickoffs anymore. 
	Huh?
 
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
	Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
 
Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
	Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
 
Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?
	Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
 
Bras?
	Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
 
How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
	Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
 
Huh. You you think the students would like that?
	Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!
 
Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
	Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
 
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
	Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
 
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
	Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
 
How's it going, coach?
	How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
 
So you're happy with these changes?
	Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
 
Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says "No," and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds.
	Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
 
Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington.
	Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
 
As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh.  Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!
	Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
 
Nice going!
	Yeah, no, you nice going! 
 
Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders.
	Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
 
Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
	Oh yeah, good one! 
 
Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in.  Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!
	Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!
 
Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!
	YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!
 
Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner.
	Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 
 
Coach Belichick says,  "No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day."
	Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
 
Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
	...Yeah... 
 
...Yeah... 
	All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
 
Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
	That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
 
Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
	That's IT! 
 
Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling.  Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show.
	Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
 
Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go.
	Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
 
Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times.  Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.
	Thanks Jim. 
 
Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
	Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
 
Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
	Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
 
I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
	Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
 
Do you mean that?
	Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.
 
Uh hum. Mmm.  I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage.
	Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
 
You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.
	So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 
 
Ohh, rreally? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball?  Really?  That's fascinating. Please, go on.
	No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
 
You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains.
	My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
 
Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say "Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain."
	Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! 
 
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
	STAN?! Stan! 
 
Dad?
	Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
 
Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! 
	Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!
 
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
	Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
 
Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
	Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
 
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
	I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
 
Yeah Dad. You need some of this. 
	... This is cum. 
 
We'll talk about that when you're older!
	Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 
 
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
	Ohhhh... 
 
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
	Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
 
How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!
	Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
 
Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
	No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 
 
Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya.
	Oh, is that so?
 
If I can just get your signature right  there?
	Sure um... Chad, is it?
 
Thad.
	Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
 
Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.
	Yeah I'll bet. 
 
Well, have a good one.
	Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
 
Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?
	Yeah, w-what are they?
 
You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
	You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
 
Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
	Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
 
Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
	Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
 
I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
	How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
 
Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.
	You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
 
What are you-?
	You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
 
Look, you can have whatever's in the back! Ih-ihit's all stuff from Amazon!
	Oh no, pull in here.
 
Just let me go, huh?
	Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 
 
Come on honey! 
	Thought we wouldn't find out??? 
 
And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
	Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
 
What?
	Huh? Nothing.
 
Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home.
	Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?
 
Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
	And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
 
He casually dropped this on his way out! 
	Oh my God! 
 
Didn't kill 'im, did ya?  Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya.
	We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
 
Son of a bitch, it's him all right!
	This guy doesn't know when to quit!
 
Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.
	Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?
 
This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
	Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
 
Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm.  Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity.
	Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
 
Yes, that's mine.
	Yours? What?
 
Hello?
	It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
 
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
	Hellooo family!  Who wants champagne? 
 
Randy, what is all this? 
	It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
 
Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!
	And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
 
Randy, are you being serious? 
	I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 
 
Blockbuster Video?
	Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
 
Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
	You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
 
I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
	Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
 
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
	Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
 
I don't wanna go in there.
	Shelly come on!
 
Shelly come on!
	Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
 
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
	Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
 
I didn't say anything.
	You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
 
You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
	How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
 
Six.  We still, have, SIX. 
	Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
 
No way, I ain't goin' nere that place. Yeeeyou go get it. 
	Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
 
What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
	Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
 
AAAAAH! 
	Little fucking pricks. 
 
Little fucking pricks. 
	Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?
 
I can't find...  Turner & Hooch.  Where's Turner & Hooch?
	Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
 
Aahh... 
	Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
 
Emily?  Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster!
	Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
 
The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now! 
	I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
 
The hounds, Emily! The hounds!
	Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
 
Yehay!
	Hey, whoa, what are you doing?
 
Stan's about to go out with his friends.
	Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!
 
For what?!
	Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
 
Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.
	You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
 
Dad, nobody's gonna come.
	Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
 
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
	Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!
 
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
	Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 
 
Come on, let's get out of here. 
	They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
 
They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
	Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
 
Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?
	I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
 
Coming right up. 
	No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
 
Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?
	He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
 
You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh.  You must be willing to do anything.
	No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
 
Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?
	According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 
 
Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that.
	Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
 
Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 
	Okay.  STAN!  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!
 
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
	Who are you people?! You aren't real!
 
Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go? 
	Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
 
Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
	Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
 
HAAAAA! 
	Haarrrr! 
 
Haarrrr! 
	Raaaawr! 
 
AAAAA!
	Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
 
AAAAA!  AAAAA!
	AAAAA!  AAAAA! 
 
FIRE! 
	Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?!
 
Stay gold. 
	Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!  Stan! 
 
I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
	No...
 
You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
	Yeah...
 
You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
	Okay...
 
What do you want from McDonald's?
	Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
 
Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
	Oh I feel like such an idiot.
 
It's all right, Dad.
	But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.
 
Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high.
	All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
 
Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper. 
	I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
 
According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like "Cold Case Files," "Dateline: Murder," and "Deadly Affairs" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like "Southern Fried Homicide," "Sinful Secrets," "On The Case with Paula Zahn." And it's all smut and it's garbage and it'strash!Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, "If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?"
	Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.Come on it.Oh hey Stan, what's up?
 
You guys are watchin' murder porn?
	...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
 
Uh adults like documentaries.
	Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
 
Okaaay.
	Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
 
Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals.Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits,on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder,on Hot Load Case Files.
	Oh yeah!Three of the best shows in a row!
 
Is the lube over there?
	Yeah, I got lube right here.
 
Well get over here, big guy.
	Yeah-hah!
 
Yeah-hah!
	What the?What the hell?Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
 
What the?What the hell?Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
	Stan. Stan!How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
 
What?
	What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
 
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff.
	Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!Stan?You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son!
 
How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
	It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
 
No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
	What?! We'll see about this!Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
 
I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company.Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there?Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town.
	Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
 
As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.
	Oh. Well okay, great.
 
We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?
	NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
 
Oh, you can't?Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?
	I can't afford DirecTV.
 
Well? Any luck?
	No, just the usual cable-company stuff.
 
No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?
	I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
 
Hello?
	Hi. Corey Lanskin?
 
Yes?
	We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
 
Fuck off!
	Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we'redesperate!
 
You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!
	We have a hundred ounces of silver.
 
Punching trees?
	Why, why would we punch trees?
 
Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood?'Ow do you get wood?!
	Watching informative murder porn?
 
NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!
	Puh, punching trees?
 
Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin.
	Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
 
Youareplaying the game; thisisthe game!
	...I don't get it.
 
That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!
	Yes ah, I'm getting it now.
 
You are?
	No.
 
Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
	I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
 
I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
	Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
 
We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
	No,Iknow, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
 
Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.
	Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
 
Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft.
	Yes?
 
Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
	No, what happened?
 
Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
	Punched his trees, huh?
 
Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
	Huh.That's weird.
 
What were you doing last night?
	I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
 
Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
	Will do, officer. Will... do...
 
I'll never give up! I don't even remember doing this!Just leave me alone!
	Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
 
Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate packagewhich will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch.
	Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
 
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
	I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!Oh crap.
 
I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!Oh crap.
	Sharon, I'm I'm sorry.
 
No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
	No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
 
No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
	Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?
 
I'm here, Randy.
	It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you.
 
Diamonds.They're beautiful
	Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
 
I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
	Oh yeah? What's that?AAAGH!Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
 
Sorry. I couldn't resist.
	Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
 
Oh I did! That felt really great.
	Felt great?
 
Yeah...
	Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna killyounow.
 
Okay.Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
	That felt so good!
 
My turn again.
	Okay, hang on.
 
I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
	Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
 
You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house!
	OH! Ohoho, you bitch!Ohohunh.
 
Oh I love you, Randy.
	I love you too babe.OH!
 
The holiday season... is here, and Black Friday... is upon us. As you know, black Friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals. Last year, 26 people died, and 461 were seriously injured.This winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first twenty people in the store.For you new recruits, perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like.Or perhaps you thought workin' Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal.
	I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
 
Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
	Hey,that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?Oh, thanks!Gets a little boring around here, you know?
 
Enjoy the boredom while you can.
	So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday?
 
I did.
	Is it really as bad as they say it is?
 
Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality.
	Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.Please to put a penny in the old man's-
 
What the hell are you doing?
	Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
 
Bullshit.
	I did, Sharon.I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
 
You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
	Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
 
Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
	Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.Bzzz bzzz.
 
Available at South Park Mall staring Black Friday.
	Morning, Joe, Marcus.
 
What madness is this??
	What is it?
 
No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!
	Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
 
Doin' alright there, Rookie?
	Whoa! Haha.Yes sir!
 
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
	No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
 
Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job.
	You-d, you do?
 
I see it in you. You care about people.Same reason I do it every year.You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him.Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay.
	Yeah... awesome...
 
Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
	Alright, listen up.The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
 
I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck!
	No!
 
You didgood. The watch is yours now.
	No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
 
This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?
	No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
 
Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this.Don't let... Black Friday... be the end.
	Get back inside. We have work to do.
 
Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Males "Happy" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!
	Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
 
Oh God! They're back! The shoppers are back!
	Everybody stay put! I'll handle this.
 
Everybody stay put! I'll handle this.
	If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
 
We're notonmall property.
	Well, you're about to be.
 
Well, what if we just walk really, really slow?Black Friday!
	You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
 
We can walk really slow. Look.
	Smartasses.
 
Oh God. We're done for!
	My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
 
Get out of here! I'm done with you!Mom! Mom!Get him out of here!Get him out!
	Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he didnotdeserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!Stay tough, rookie.
 
We're not gonna make it, sir.
	We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
 
Okay.
	OKAY?!
 
Yes sir! Yes sir.
	Not one more good person dies on my watch!
 
I can't do this! I'm sorry! I can't do this!
	Stay at your post!Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
 
Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!
	Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
 
Tom Hanks and Beyonc.
	What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyonc!I've gotta save them!
 
Gimme that camera! Give it up!
	Get back! Get out of my way!Commander Marsh?
 
Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
	WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, IREALLYCARE ABOUT HIM!
 
Yay.
	Stan! You're alive! I saved you!It's okay, Beyonc! The fight's over! You can still shop!
 
Ticket proceeds help fight the gluten crisis in West Africa! It's a night of pure, pure estrogen! Tickets on sale now!
	Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
 
Come on, this is a great lineup.
	Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
 
I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
	What is that supposed to mean?
 
I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
	Yes, Freemium gaming.
 
I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush.You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over.
	IloveCandy Crush.
 
But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever!
	Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
 
She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
	And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
 
That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!
	You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
 
So can I go or not?!
	If she means that much to you.
 
Sooo you're doing it?
	How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
 
Alright guys, Uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde.Have a great show, ladies.
	Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
 
You're nervous, it's understandable.
	No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
 
You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.
	Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
 
Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!
	No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
 
That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!
	Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
 
'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
	Fuck you!
 
Hee hee.
	They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
 
Oh Lorde, you're such a purist.
	Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
 
And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!
	Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.Oh God. Sorry.Uh hold on.Hang on, uh.
 
Hee hee.I'm free! I'm free!
	Sorry folks, just one second here.
 
Hee hee!
	Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.Okay, uh, uh...Oooo!Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah!
 
Ogh! Lorde, ewww!
	Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo!
 
Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo!
	Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?Great, thanks.Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
 
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
	I was told to!
 
You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
	Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him!
 
It's dying. The living room is... dying.
	Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
 
What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
	Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
 
It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!
	This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
 
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
	Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth.
 
Sit down, Lorde.
	I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
 
Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more.Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on.The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level.
	Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
 
On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
	I'll do no such thing!
 
Who said anything about you?
	You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
 
Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
	Sharon? Sharon!
 
Randy? What's going on?
	They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
 
Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
	The hologram's in our bedroom?
 
I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit.
	You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
 
Man this sucks!
	Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
 
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
	A startup company? A company that does what?
 
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
	Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
 
Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.
	Make your dick fly off?
 
Hurry! You gotta go!
	What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
 
Yes!
	Hamburger Helper?
 
That's all gluten!
	There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
 
Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
	Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!
 
Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
	This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
 
Don't forget the freezer!
	Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
 
I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
	Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
 
All right, that's all of it!
	You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
 
I can get both of these, yeah!
	All right, come on! 
 
What are you doing to my farm?!?
	You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 
 
There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
	Yes?
 
Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?
	Gluten expohn... oh not here!
 
Can we come in please?
	Wuh sure! 
 
What's going on? 
	Well that's just a beer.
 
BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!
	Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!
 
We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.
	Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
 
We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
	No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
 
No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
	How long do I have to stay here?!
 
Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.
	What am I supposed to eat?
 
How'd you get exposed?  Bagels? Gravy?
	Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
 
Dad? Dad!
	Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
 
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
	I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
 
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
	How's your mom? Your, your sister?
 
Nonono, not yet. DAD!
	That's my son, you bastard!
 
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
	Staaan!
 
Let me talk to my dad! 
	Staaaaaaan!
 
Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
	You can't just keep us in here!
 
They're just gonna let us starve to death?
	They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 
 
There's plenty of pizza dough.
	Are you crazy?
 
I'm crazy hungry!  Oh... Oh... Fuck it's so good.  I want more! ...it's been so long! 
	Oh my God, you...  but... you're okay.
 
A setup? But by who?
	Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
 
Maybe Papa John can help us. If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- 
	Ng-oh. 
 
Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.
	Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
 
You wanna dance? 
	We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
 
Randy? Whose are these?
	Aaah I don't know. Why?
 
Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
	In my jeans?
 
Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
	...Yeah. I do.
 
Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
	Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
 
I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy,  but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us.
	You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
 
How many times have you said "I think I've lost it" and everything turned out to be okay?
	Every time?
 
Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me.
	Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. 
 
He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.
	Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
 
Randy?
	I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 
 
I was. Can you help me unload the car? 
	Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
 
Randy?
	Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. 
 
Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
	Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
 
Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
	You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
 
Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
	Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 
 
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
	Oh really? About... about what?
 
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
	Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.
 
...What?
	It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
 
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
	Yah, that's my cover.
 
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
	Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.
 
Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
	Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  "Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."
 
Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
	Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."  Stan?
 
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
	You wanted to see me, boss?
 
Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde.
	Hi Carol.
 
Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off.
	Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
 
Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom.  Everyone loves you, but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom. 
	I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
 
My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with 
	With what?  With what? 
 
You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
	It's okay, it's gluten free.
 
Timmy! 
	I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
 
What started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis. As electronic cars challenge the oil industry, and transportation alternatives fight for dominance, the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the '70s. It appears that the world is once again on the brink  of Wacky Races.
	Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
 
Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
	I know! Are we watching at your house?!
 
God help them all.
	All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
 
Wow.
	Geez!
 
God.
	Did you see that?! Oh!
 
Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again.
	Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! 
 
Oh no, I can't watch! 
	Oooo! Booom!
 
Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course.But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular. I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks, and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy. Oh-ohh, God I'm sorry Laura.You know I I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right? Nothin' to do with you p-personally. I mean, how would I even know? I didn't see it.Um...
	Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry.
 
But now, because I "choose" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,
	Eeww.
 
Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
	It's simple.
 
It's simple.
	Oh yeah, this is gonna work great.
 
Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick fromHunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
	Heheh, Gerald is watchingHousewives of Atlanta.
 
You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
	I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.Oh shit!Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!I've been shot!No! Noooo!
 
What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
	I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
 
Randy. We need to talk.
	Okay.
 
Inside.I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiastdidn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?
	No. I didn't.
 
I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.
	What might be?
 
Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??
	...Drones are spooky?
 
It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun.
	You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?!
 
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
	You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"?
 
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
	Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
 
I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
	How?!
 
I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
	Can you believe him?! Heknewhow much he was spending! Heknewhe'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
 
Wull whattaya mean?
	Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
 
Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
	Ihada problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
 
You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK!Please drink responsibly.
	Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.Come on Dad, we're going home.
 
I'm going.
	Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
 
What are you talkin' about?
	I just don't understand what iswrongwith you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
 
Yeah, it's fun.
	It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
 
Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
	I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
 
Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.
	All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
 
...Free?
	What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
 
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
	$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
 
One?
	Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
 
No, no, it's not.
	You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
 
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
	I am not chugging beer!I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural!
 
...Okay.Aaaaahhh!
	Oh pass interference! Interference!
 
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me.
	Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that.
 
Well okay, good idea.
	What are you gaywads doin'?
 
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
	Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine.
 
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
	It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
 
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies.
	You guys wanna put some money on it?
 
Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong. And anyone I find involved with this filth is going down!
	Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
 
Dad, it's not that big a deal.
	It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
 
You were?
	Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
 
Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
	Oh? Not impressed? How about this? 
 
Randy?
	Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
 
Randy, what are you doing?!
	Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!
 
Randy, why are there drums playing? 
	All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
 
Ohhh, no no nononononono no.
	Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
 
I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
	Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
 
Stanley??
	People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 
 
Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 
	Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 
 
Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
	Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
 
They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?
	Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 
 
Ah, dude, your dad's here.
	Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 
 
Ewww! 
	Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
 
I'll volunteer.
	Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
 
I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.
	All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
 
Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?
	Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
 
Who's the famous artist?
	Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
 
You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
	No! That was a copy of me!
 
Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh!
	Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
 
That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
	Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.
 
Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant.
	Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
 
They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever!
	A holiday special. Oh my God.
 
As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay.
	I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!Can you help me stop them?!
 
Yes. We have to reach the children. It's our only hope.
	Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
 
See if it started!
	We don't really use this thing anymore.It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
 
Randy, what about Shelley?
	Oh my God...
 
Shelley? who's Shelley? That's ignorant.
	My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
 
How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
	I guess... one step at a time.
 
I guess... one step at a time.
	Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you.Whew, that was hard.
 
It's me. I've got somethin' you might be interested in.
	I don't think so, you son of a bitch!
 
What??
	Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!
 
Randy, where are you going?!
	THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!SHIT!!
 
Hey, what's that?
	What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean?  Uh huh  Uh huh  Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 
 
Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.
	Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
 
What does this mean to the town?
	Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.
 
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
	Mayor, I might have an idea.
 
Huh, what?
	If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.
 
And, that would be good? Alright?
	Uh - pretty sure.
 
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
	And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
 
Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
	Uhh...
 
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
	Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?
 
It's not Stan's fault.
	Huh?
 
It wasn't Stan, he wasit was with me the whole time.
	Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.
 
Now blow out the candles grampa.  Hurray!!!
	How's it feel to be 102, paps?
 
I wish I were dead
	Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grampa.
 
I will.
	Me.
 
Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.
	Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 
 
We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House. 
	Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
 
No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. 
	Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.
 
Here honey, talk to your father.
	Did you turn the heat down?
 
Dad, Death is coming!
	Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. 
 
Here they are!
	Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
 
Huh?  Oh yeah.
	Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
 
Ey! 
	Uhh, yes, Officer?
 
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
	Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
 
Step out of the car, please, sir.
	Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
 
Sir, step out of the car, please.
	Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
 
Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
	Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!
 
Get your ass to jail! 
	Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
 
Sweet.
	Ooww!
 
ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
	Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it!
 
Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
	How do we get our runaway children back?
 
...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries.
	Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
 
There there now, it's not your fault.
	Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
 
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
	Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.
 
Wait! Where are you going?
	We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
 
Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
	See ya, son. 
 
Huuuh!
	Doctor?
 
Yes?
	Wh-where's Stan?
 
Stan?
	Stan, our son?
 
Oh my God! Our son ran away!
	Will he be okay out of the hospital?
 
Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.
	Okay, well well, let's go look--
 
Oh God, no!
	I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
 
Stanley?
	Stan?
 
Oh, Stanley, where are you..?
	Stan?
 
Hooray! 
	Stanley, where the hell have you been?
 
I don't wanna go back there.
	Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. 
 
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
	What?
 
The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
	Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?
 
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
	I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
 
Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!
	Uh oh! 
 
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
	No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 
 
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
	Okay.
 
How do we do it?
	Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
 
Yeah, dude! How'd you know? 
	How do you think I met your mother?
 
Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!
	Oh, brother. 
 
Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
	Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.
 
Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
	Okay, okay. 
 
Did you find it?
	Give me a second, would you?
 
Don't snap at me!
	I didn't snap at you.
 
You snapped at me!
	Whatever.
 
What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!
	I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.
 
I'm sorry, too.
	Uh I think I found it. 
 
That's not it, you idiot!
	Hey, back off, cunt!
 
You just said the C-word!
	Did I?
 
Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
	Stanley, I... Skylarkings?
 
Yeahmkay?
	Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
 
You really should know better, Stanley.
	You need to shape up, mister.
 
Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
	I don't interrupt you.
 
Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--
	Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
 
Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
	When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
 
Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.
	Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
 
Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
	Oh, please!
 
He is. 
	No, she is. 
 
Weak!  Dad?
	Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
 
But I don't understand why we have to--
	Well, hello, ladies.
 
Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.
	I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
 
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
	Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
 
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
	Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.
 
What? That's it?
	Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
 
This is bullcrap! 
	Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
 
Oh, Randy. What are you doing here? 
	I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
 
Oh I thought that note was for me.
	Oh, maybe it was.
 
Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
	I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
 
Goodnight.
	Sharon?
 
Yes? 
	Truth or Dare?
 
It's too late for games. 
	No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?
 
Truth.
	Do you still love me?
 
Sharon--  Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
	Well, you never know. Maybe--
 
He-
	--thing will work out.
 
Sharon?
	Dare.
 
You guys are just hella jealous.
	Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
 
Can you leave the light on, Dad?
	Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
 
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
	Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 
 
Come on, we're running out of time. 
	Hey, why is the basement door locked? 
 
Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.
	Sharon?
 
Yyes, hon?
	There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
 
Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. 
	Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
 
Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
	What is it?
 
I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
	Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
 
Damn it!
	I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
 
Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
	Uuuh, do you want your pants back?
 
I'll leave it up to your father.
	Eh, it's fine with me.
 
I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
	Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
 
Really?
	Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
 
The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
	...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.
 
Right.
	Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
 
Make love to me, Randy. Please!
	Wow.
 
Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
	Or else what?
 
God must be very angry with us. But why?  How have we angered you, Lord?
	Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
 
Dad, where's our Bible?
	Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
 
Or else what?
	Exactly.
 
...What?
	Right.
 
Where's our Bible?
	It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
 
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
	New girlfriend?
 
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
	Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.
 
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
	Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!
 
Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
	All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?
 
All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?
	Damn it! How come you're not combusting? 
 
Another one! Another one combusted! 
	No! Has she been doing anything odd?
 
No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house.
	Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
 
Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
	No! I think I might have it.
 
Mayor.
	Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
 
Why?
	Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.
 
Make love to me, Randy. Please!
	Wow. 
 
All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?
	The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
 
You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?
	Exactly. 
 
You're the best, Randy!
	I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
 
No! No, this can't be!
	Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
 
It's already on full.
	You wanted to see me, Mayor?
 
Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.
	I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
 
Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
	Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
 
All right, all right. Name your price.
	Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
 
Done. Just find out what's happening.
	Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 
 
Dad, where's the phone book?
	Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?
 
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
	Stan?
 
I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is  Randy Marsh!  It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!
	Awww crap.
 
Boy, they're really pissed.
	Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
 
Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. 
	Hey!
 
Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore! 
	Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
 
You fraud! 
	Mr. Garrison, help me!
 
The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts.  Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:
	I-I don't know what to say.
 
What are you doing, dad?
	Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
 
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
	Hm. Really?
 
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
	Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
 
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
	What?
 
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
	You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
 
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
	All right. Now, let's get to work.
 
Dad. Dad! 
	Wow!
 
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
	...Right, right right.
 
Get him!
	Uh. Please, everyone- 
 
You're a dead man, Marsh!
	Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.
 
Could I borrow one of your rocks?
	It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
 
Huh? 
	I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
 
Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!
	No problem, Jakov.
 
You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
	Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
 
But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?
	Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov.
 
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
	Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
 
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
	Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
 
Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.
	Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
 
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
	Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
 
Here you go, it's right in here. 
	We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
 
Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. 
	One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
 
Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. 
	Yeah, experiment.
 
Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.
	Hell, we should get in.
 
Well, screw you guys! 
	I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!
 
Which Angel am I again?
	Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
 
Yeah, I know what you mean.
	I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
 
Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 
	Good idea.
 
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
	Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
 
Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
	Huh? Oh, you mean, this?
 
Yeah.
	Yeah. That, that was me.
 
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
	Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
 
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
	O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
 
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
	With two girls or two guys?
 
Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 
	You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
 
You haven't?
	No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
 
Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
	Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
 
NO, no, uh I don't think so.
	...Well it is a night for experimenting.
 
Sure is. 
	Okay, I'll start. 
 
So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
	...Yeah.
 
Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
	No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
 
Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
	Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 
 
Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
	Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. 
 
I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
	Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
 
...What??
	Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
 
Where is he?!
	Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.
 
Hey, Randy. What are you doing? 
	Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
 
Can I come with you?
	Okay. 
 
Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
	I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
 
So, so now we can't be friends?
	I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
 
We said we'd never tell anybody?
	Well, of course we wouldn't.
 
Oh, uh I didn't realize that. 
	Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?
 
Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.
	What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
 
You didn't say not to tell anyone.
	Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! 
 
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
	AAAW!! 
 
Oh, is he?
	Who?!
 
Huh?
	Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
 
Ricky Martin, the singer.
	Oh. 
 
Hey, Randy, what's up?
	What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
 
Huh?
	Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
 
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
	There's nothing to talk about.
 
You're having regrets, aren't you?
	No, I-... I don't know.
 
Hey. Talk to me.
	No!
 
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
	Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
 
Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.
	Aaww!  Sharon?  Sharon, cuh can we go?
 
Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
	Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
 
Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
	Ogh, I already did.
 
Dad! Dad, they shot at us.
	Not now, Stanley. 
 
Having a good time?
	Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
 
I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
	We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 
 
Honey?
	God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows.
 
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
	What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
 
I just want to know it meant something to you.
	It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 
 
Aw, I was just in the hot tub. 
	Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
 
Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita? 
	You mean it? I'm not gay?
 
Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
	Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!
 
So we're friends again?
	Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
 
Amerika ni, kodomo zenbu Chinpokomon motte iru. Kore kara, "phase two" hajimete. IKIMASHOO!  The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!
	What are you doing?
 
I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
	Why?
 
Roo-oo-oostor! 
	...Are those good moral values?
 
This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
	I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
 
Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
	Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
 
No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
	My God, you're right.
 
Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
	Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
 
We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
	Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
 
Huwell, uh he's got a point there.
	Well, I guess that settles that.
 
Nan da kore? 
	Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! 
 
What?
	Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
 
It's a trick!
	Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?
 
Nooo!!
	Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
 
Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 
	Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
 
Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
	Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
 
Yeah! 
	Lynch mob! 
 
Wow! That was easy.
	Here's their van! Here's their van!
 
Aaaaaah!
	KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
 
Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. 
	Uh, look, Mr....
 
Cotswolds.
	Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
 
Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?
	Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
 
Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. 
	Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?
 
Yeah. He's a badass! 
	Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. 
 
Forward! 
	Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! 
 
Yeah!
	Alright men, fire! 
 
Yeah! 
	Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
 
Ow.
	Yeh-hah! 
 
What the hell?
	He took the bell!
 
You Yankee sons of bitches!
	Ow! That hurt!
 
Come on!
	Oh?
 
Surrender your men, general!
	Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!
 
SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!
	Alright, alright. We surrender. 
 
Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. 
	Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
 
I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
	All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
 
You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
	Huh?
 
Yeah.
	Well, the Union be damned!
 
Yeah!
	Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!
 
Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store.
	WHERE?!
 
At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!
	Come on, boys! 
 
Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
	Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!
 
Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?
	We're out of s'more schnapps?
 
Ouch.
	Oh, my head.
 
We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
	Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
 
This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
	Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
 
Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl.  We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need.
	Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
 
You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
	Ey, that sounds fun. 
 
We got it! The fort is ours! 
	What was that?? 
 
Wow!
	A whole year?
 
We want to see God!
	Yeah, with our own eyes.
 
Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.
	We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
 
Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  Be ye not afraid.  Blessed art thou, my children. 
	That's God?
 
Timmy!
	Okay, is everyone ready to go?
 
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow. 
	You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 
 
We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
	You're from Cirque du Cheville. 
 
Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
	Well...
 
That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
	Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!
 
What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
	Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
 
You're damn right she's tired.
	Huh?
 
All right!
	Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 
 
Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha.
	No, Dad.
 
A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
	No, Dad, she's dead!
 
What?!  Oh, dear Jesus!
	It looks like she had a heart attack.
 
No wonder she didn't say good-night.
	...Ew!
 
I don't know how to tell. You tell them. 
	Uh, girls, we... have some bad news.
 
What?
	Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 
 
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
	Well, Stan, it's not really our-
 
Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. 
	What? 
 
Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
	Uh-oh.
 
Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? 
	I don't know.
 
Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
	That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
 
Alright!
	Stan, we- 
 
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
	I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 
 
Oh, look. An Easter egg.
	Oh, shi- 
 
Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. 
	Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
 
Last night I went, "O!"Bububudio. 
	Wasn't that great, son?
 
Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?
	Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
 
Oh well, that sounds nice.
	No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.
 
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
	If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?
 
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
	You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 
 
Go get 'em, rookie! 
	Where is Stan?
 
Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
	What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
 
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
	And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 
 
Oh uh, Kyle has it. 
	Stanley, what the hell are you doing?
 
We are making a music video.
	You get in the truck right now! 
 
Dad, I was just a--
	Get in the truck! 
 
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
	Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
 
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
	Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
 
No.
	Well, maybe it's time.
 
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
	Because I said so!
 
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
	Let 'em be pissed off, then!
 
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
	No!!  NOOO!! 
 
Dad? What the hell is going on?
	...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. 
 
Kid, can I talk to you?
	Uh sure.
 
Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.
	Ohh, thanks.
 
Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
	What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
 
Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
	Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
 
Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
	No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
 
I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. 
	And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
 
And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
	See ya. 
 
See ya. 
	...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
 
...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
	See ya. 
 
See ya. 
	...And I left my family.
 
...And I left my family.
	See ya. 
 
See ya. 
	And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 
 
You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it
What you've got is it!
	It's obvious to me, girl
 
It's obvious to me, girl
	The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 
 
Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!
	Now, give it to me, 'cause...
 
Now, give it to me, 'cause...
	I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...
 
Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
	Hey, Mr. Allens.
 
Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
	Who are they? 
 
These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band.
	But, w-we're still selling records, right?
 
Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band.
	I'm 19.
 
Get a life, Marsh!  Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
	They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
 
See ya. 
	...the women all left...
 
See ya. 
	...and they took back my house.
 
...and they took back my house.
	Ugh..! 
 
See ya. 
	The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
 
Sure, I remember you!  You got it, baby... You got it, baby 
	And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
 
Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
	I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarrayus, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 
 
Dad?
	Huh? Yeah?
 
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
	Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
 
Yeah.
	You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
 
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
	Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
 
Really?
	Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
 
You were great, Dad.
	Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
 
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
	Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 
 
A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ!  Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world!  That is all. Peace be with you. 
	Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.
 
Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
	Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
 
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
	Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
 
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
	Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
 
Alright parents, let's all take our seats.  My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor.
	Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
 
Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?
	That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
 
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
	Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
 
Yeah.
	Yeah.
 
Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
	Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
 
Oh, was that it? Was that it?!
	Shipped. He said "shipped".
 
Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!
	Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
 
Well, they can't use "fag". Because you can't say "fag" unless you're a homosexual.
	Really? So we can't say ***?
 
Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". 
	...Hey, you didn't get beeped.
 
I didn't know.  I didn't know!!!
	I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
 
Yeah.
	That makes sense.
 
Hah, I love you guys.
	Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
 
Well, now, that's part of the fun.
	Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
 
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
	Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
 
Timmay!
	You're the new scout leader?
 
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
	He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
 
Well then, I don't want my boy there, either. 
	So he's a homosexual. So what?
 
You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. 
	Aw, that's ridiculous.
 
Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.
	Come on, Stanley.
 
Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas.
	Come on, Stan.
 
Ah.
	What did you say?!
 
Uh huh!
	You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
 
Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
	Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
 
...Asshole. 
	That's better.
 
Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual.
	Nice to meet you.
 
Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
	Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
 
Yes sir Scoutmaster! 
	Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
 
Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside.
	You bet.
 
I heard that.
	See ya, Mr. Grazier. 
 
What do we want?
	Oh, no.
 
This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
	Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.
 
Kenny?
	Oh my God.
 
Alright! Yeah! Woohoo! 
	Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
 
Red rocket, red rocket!
	WAAAH!
 
No!
	Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
 
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
	No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
 
You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
	Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
 
Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!
	Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 
 
Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
	What?
 
Can huh get th'ere 'or me? 
	Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 
 
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
	Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
 
...as more and more case of terrorist-related AIDS continues to grow. And this just in: the Taliban has apparently taken American civilians as hostages. The Taliban has just released this videotape , in which it is clearly visible that they have indeed captured  Stevie Nicks. Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits, though her whereabouts are unknown.
	Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?
 
Yes. I just saw him.
	Oh okay. 
 
What the hell was that?
	I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.
 
It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? 
	Oh, man, it that the IT?
 
What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
	Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
 
Sure.
	Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
 
Yeup.
	Well... so... they don't really... do anything.
 
Right.
	So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
 
It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.
	Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?
 
But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
	Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
 
Randy...
	They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
 
Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours! 
His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-
	Here he comes! 
 
Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! 
	Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 
 
Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before.
	Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
 
Friends, by default. 
	Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
 
No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..
	They let you stay for free?
 
Well that sounds like a good deal.
	Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
 
Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?
	Oh, do we have to do it right now?
 
I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
	Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
 
Share,  time.  Time share.
	So then it's not really ours.
 
Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary "I've got a nice little place in Aspen?" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives.
	Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
 
What?
	Wait...
 
And then share it with the people who come tomorrow.
	All right, look, we've been here for over three hours
 
Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.
	No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
 
Finally, we get to go skiing!
	Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
 
Thank you. 
	Well, this certainly is nice.
 
We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
	Oh, God-damnit!
 
Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show.
	No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 
 
That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!
	Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!
 
I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation.
	Let's just get out of here. 
 
The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!
That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)
And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)
And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)
In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)
Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)
If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)
	All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
 
That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. "Book 'em, Danno!" 
	Oh, Jesus.
 
Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.
	Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
 
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
	Stanley, they belong to him.
 
No!
	Stan, you're behaving like a kid!
 
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
	Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
 
We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. 
	We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
 
Okay. Up a little... left a little...  Almost there.
	What is that?
 
We're giving the boys some guns in return for our calves
	What?
 
And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on "Star Trek" to drive the truck.  In full makeup.
	Jesus Christ!
 
He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
	Vaginitis?
 
That sounds pretty fun.
	A Catholic boat trip? 
 
The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin' on out today.
The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away.
Get some hot Christian action; it'll make you-
	Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.
 
Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.
	Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
 
Maybe they wanna kill us.
	With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
 
I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
	It couldn't hurt.
 
Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?
	You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
 
Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!
	Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.
 
...Same thing.
	Yeah! 
 
Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!
	Stan, you're an atheist now!
 
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
	Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
 
What? He did.
	Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.
 
Yeah it does.
	No it doesn't.
 
Yeah. It does. 
	Honey! Honey, come quick!
 
Very well. Here we go.  Hmmm, there's a ladder up here.  Oh my God, a rattlesnake!  A way back up!  I've made it! Praise be to God! He hath shown me the way!  This must be it. The Holy Document of Vatican Law. 
	Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 
 
That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying "under God" every day at school. That could really damage him. "Under God" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  Moowwaaagh.  "Under God" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.
	That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
 
Yeah, the pope is gone!
	Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
 
Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the real world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change.
	He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
 
O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
	Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
 
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
	No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 
 
Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
	Why? What's the matter with him?
 
Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
	Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
 
Ahta. Ah, ahta!
	Hey there, son.
 
Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.
	Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.
 
Ahah
	Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.
 
Ahta? 
	But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
 
Friend. Ahta.
	I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
 
I love you.
	If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
 
People, people, calm down.
	Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
 
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
	Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
 
Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.
	Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
 
Hey. Hey hey!  Hey, what the hell you doing?!  Mongorians? What the hell Mongorians doing here?  Ey, fuck you, Mongorians! Tryin' break down my wall!  Get out of here, fuckin' Mongorians!  God-damnit, how come every time us Chinese put up a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come and knock it down?
	Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
 
It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
	If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
 
If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
	There, I think that's got it. 
 
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
	You can barely even tell you have one on.
 
But, wait. Where's the other team? 
	There is no other team.
 
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
	Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 
 
Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
	Yeah, and you kicked ass!
 
Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? 
	Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
 
But why do I have to leave?
	The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
 
Where are we supposed to go?
	We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! 
 
Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back! 
	Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. 
 
Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are. 
	What's the matter? 
 
Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
	Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 
 
Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?
	Sweetheart, you saw the news...
 
I know. 
	Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
 
Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through this wall is through me. This is my rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance now.  Does my war dance ascare you, Mongolians? Yeah, you think you want a piece of this?  This is ancient Chinese dance of a- Oh, herro kids. Uh be careful, there's a-Mongolians up there.  Oh, crap! 
	What's going on?
 
Mongolians?
	What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
 
Kids? Don't you remember us?
	Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
 
Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
	Bi kute.
 
They're starting to remember.
	Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!
 
Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
	That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! 
 
Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.
	No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
 
Randy, can we just take our son home now?
	Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 
 
A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
	Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
 
We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
	A ladder to heaven? Why, son?
 
Oh... oh, that's so sweet.
	That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
 
Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?
	The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
 
Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
	No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
 
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to-  a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again.  It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say.
	Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.
 
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
	No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
 
Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action.
	Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
 
Cremated? What's that?
	When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 
 
Jesus Christ!
	The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
 
Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!
	What? 
 
That's the news from heben.  Dame! Dame da! Bakayarou da!! 
	Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
 
Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?
	If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. 
 
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
	Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
 
Sir!
	No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
 
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
	Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
 
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
	Yeah, whatever.
 
Ho! 
	Hmmm, that gets rid of them.
 
Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?
	Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.
 
Oho, you little devil.
	You wanna go watch?
 
Hey there, cowboy.
	You ready for some hot, steamy fun?
 
You bet I am.
	The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." 
 
Mmm, sounds good.
	I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?
 
Mm, yeah baby.
	Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?
 
Ready.
	Oh, yeah. 
 
The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar.
	Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
 
Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
	Oh yeah. 
 
Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. 
	Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
 
But then that mean..?
	The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
 
Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." 
	Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
 
The boys! 
	Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?
 
Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
	Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
 
This sounds like a really important quest.
	Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
 
Gentlemen, we are off! 
	Okay, problem solved.
 
Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon.
	Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?
 
What's the matter?
	We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 
 
They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
	The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
 
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
	And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
 
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
	I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. 
 
Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
	It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
 
Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter?
	We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
 
Token?  Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. 
	Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.
 
Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!
	Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
 
They took it back to the video s... the video s...
	The video sandwich?
 
The video stockyard.
	What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?
 
Hurry! Hurry!
	I know where it is! 
 
Uh-oh.
	Boys! Boys!
 
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
	There you are!
 
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
	A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.
 
Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
	That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
 
It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
	Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
 
...Wow. 
	Well, let's all get going.
 
Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
	Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 
 
Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
	Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.
 
Yeah, but Dad-
	No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
 
We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities.  Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? 
	Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. 
 
Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.
	Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." 
 
Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? 
	Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
 
Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! 
	That's our Cartman. 
 
Well, that's the end of our tour.
	Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
 
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
	Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
 
Get along, little Slave.
	Oh my God.
 
Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  "Tolerate" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!
	He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
 
No, no, I think I have a better idea.
	We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
 
It's me, Mom, your son Stan. 
	Who is it, Sharon?
 
Dad!
	Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
 
No, I'm you from the future!  Oh man, this is so messed up.
	Okay, we've had enough!
 
Randy, what's going on?
	I don't know.
 
I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out.
	How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
 
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
	Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
 
So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding.
	I think he's pretty scared alright.
 
So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism.  Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means.
	Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
 
Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?
	Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
 
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
	Oh. You. You don't?
 
No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
	Well, you know what I think, Stan?
 
What?
	I think he IS from the future.
 
Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?
	Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
 
Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up- 
	Oh, Stan! 
 
Hide and go seek, huh?!
	Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
 
I don't believe that he's my future self!
	Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
 
But I have to know for sure. 
	Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. 
 
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
	Stan...
 
Yes?
	Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
 
AAAH! 
	AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
 
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
	Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 
 
Get the fuck out of here. 
	Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
 
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
	Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
 
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
	Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
 
He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them
	Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
 
Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!
	You really did a nice job, Eric. 
 
Awwww!
	Christmas is ruined again! 
 
WOW!!! 
	Stan!
 
Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head. 
	Oh, what a fighter.
 
Yeah! Right!
	The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
 
There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. 
	How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
 
Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.
	He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 
 
Okay, people. What are we rabbling about now?
	Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
 
Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!
	Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!
 
All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
	Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!
 
Oh, Jesus...
	Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
 
(I'm doing my homework.)
	The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 
 
God damnit!
	Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
 
People, I told you, you have to share the stage.
	Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
 
Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.
	Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
 
I'm a little for supportin' our troops.
	And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
 
I believe freedom isn't free.
	No, but war shouldn't be our goal.
 
We must defend our country.
	If it means war, then we say NO!
 
'Did you forget them towers in New York?'Did you forget how it made you feel'To see them towers come down?'Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?
	I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
 
We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.
	Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
 
Booooo!!
	For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 
 
I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
	He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
 
Hey I'm a little bit country
	And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH! 
 
I'll be the muscle of America
	And me, I'll be the caring soul.
 
And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal 
To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.
	Come on up here, everybody! 
 
Let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every pole 
Cuz we're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll.
	Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
 
Man, Indians have it good, huh?
	Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
 
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 
	All right, time to win some money!
 
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
	Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 
 
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
	How's it goin', Gerald?
 
Ohh, not so good.
	Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
 
Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.
	Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
 
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
	Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!
 
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
	Where did you get that kind of money??
 
That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?
	Just six quarters!
 
What's wrong with Gerald?
	He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
 
What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
	They don't care. 
 
And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
	But how can they do that?!
 
Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
	No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! 
 
Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! 
	How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
 
Three hundred thousand dollars. 
	Ohhh, never mind. 
 
Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!
	How can you do this to people?
 
We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits.
	There's more to life than profits!
 
Well like what?
	Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. 
 
No!
	Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
 
It's a long shot.
	Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
 
HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!
	All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 
 
Dad.  Good luck.
	It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 
 
What are they doing?
	We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 
 
We can save the town and be super-rich!
	Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
 
AWWWWWWW!!
	Dammit!
 
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
	Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
 
A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
	Stan? Okay?
 
What???
	All right? Stan? Okay?
 
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 
	Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.
 
Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
	Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
 
I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.
	It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
 
But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
	We can stand here as long as it takes. 
 
Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too. 
	What do they want?
 
Please. As a token of good faith.
	You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
 
It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh.
	Well, thanks. 
 
It's all right, dad.
	How's your... mother?
 
She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
	It's cool on my tongue.
 
You're gonna be all right.
	Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
 
No, Dad, NO.
	Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 
 
What can I do?
	You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
 
Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!
	The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 
 
This would never have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!
	Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
 
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
	Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 
 
Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth!  What the?  Wait a minute.  Stop! Stop!  Your, your SARS. Where did it go?
	We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
 
It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him, but your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life.
	We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
 
Oh, is the game on or something? 
	Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! 
 
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 
	Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.
 
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
	It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
 
Huh.
	Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.
 
Oh hey Randy.
	You're looking ultra-fabulous.
 
Well thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?
	Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.
 
Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!
	Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
 
Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
	Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 
 
Craig! Behave yourself!
	Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?
 
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
	What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
 
Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.
	Oh really?!
 
Ooooo.
	Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
 
NO!
	Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
 
This is crazy!
	Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!
 
(Woohoohoo!)
	Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
 
Whoa, look out! 
	Oh my God, it's on fire! 
 
Put it out! Put it out!
	I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
 
Eeeek!
	Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
 
Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.
	Hey eses.
 
God dammit! 
	Stan, are you okay?
 
Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. 
	Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
 
If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.
	Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
 
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
	Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.
 
But they kill people.
	Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
 
I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!
	Yes Dad.
 
And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
	Yes I know.
 
Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!
	Sharon, have you seen Dad?
 
He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
	Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
 
Every senior in town will be driving home...
	At the same time.  Oh My God!
 
At the same time.  Oh My God!
	Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 
 
Goodbye, Missy. 
	Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!
 
We've gotta get out of here!
	The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!
 
They, they're... they're playing street hockey!
	Oh My God!! 
 
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
	GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
 
Dude, look!
	GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
 
I don't know.
	GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!
 
I can't understand him.
	GAAAAAH!!
 
Old people!
	Come on! 
 
Oh God, they're coming! 
	Get over there! Stay low! 
 
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
	Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!
 
I don't remember there being a building here.
	RUN! 
 
I told you to turn left, Larry.
	Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 
 
Excuse me, is this Costello Avenue? 
	In here! 
 
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
	Quiet! Keep quiet! 
 
Dad, I'm scared.
	Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. 
 
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
	Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 
 
I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
	Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
 
Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!
	You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
 
Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
	We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?
 
Kiss my sagging ass!
	Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
 
Oh, I suppose so.
	What the hell is going on?!
 
Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!
	Dad, what are you doing??
 
Heh??  No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!
	This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
 
Hey Dad.
	Stan! Boys! You're safe!
 
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
	They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
 
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
	Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
 
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
	No, son. We... like to sleep in.
 
Two hostages come front and center! 
	They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!
 
All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages.  That was a great strategy, boys. You may very well have saved this entire country. 
	Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?
 
It's up to the townspeople.
	Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
 
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
	Huh?
 
I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.
	Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
 
Sure. I'll drive.
	That's our Grandpa. 
 
Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
	Who?
 
That's not what the Harrisons said.
	Who are the Harrisons?
 
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
	Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
 
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
	We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
 
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
	All right, that does it!
 
Where are you going?
	I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 
 
Randy, don't cause trouble.
	Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
 
Yeah.
	Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! 
 
Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! 
	God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 
 
Hello!
	Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?
 
I sure am.  The, the name's Gary.
	Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
 
Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!
	Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
 
Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!
	Well, thanks. Uh...
 
I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.
	Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
 
Uh huh?
	You know. About... God, and stuff.
 
Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.
	Well, I-
 
We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!
	Well, no, no, I just-
 
You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said "Who the heck do these people think they are?!" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.
	Y-you can call me... Randy.
 
To each his own, right?
	Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
 
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
	Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
 
See? That's what happened to me!
	Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
 
What are you talking about?
	Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
 
That's what they made me think, too!
	All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
 
And that's how the Book of Mormon was written
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.
	One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
 
I wanna watch TV.
	We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
 
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
	And?  Your turn, Sharon.
 
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
	Yes.
 
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
	Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
 
Hey Gary.
	Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
 
Yeah! Woohoo!
	Ooo, what's that?
 
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
	Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.
 
Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
	Yeah! 
 
Randy!
	Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!
 
Ohoh, really?? Do you think lung cancer is cool, too?? 
	What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? 
 
And what about abortion, and AIDS? 
	Pfft! That's none's the cool.
 
So don't believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you!
	Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
 
Mom...  Dad, it was just a-
	I don't have a son!
 
Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?
	Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
 
Daaaad!
	What?
 
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
	Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
 
Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it! 
	Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
 
What?
	Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
 
Butters! 
	What happened to him?
 
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.
	What's the matter with him?
 
Oh. Stan got served at school today.
	You got served? By who?
 
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
	So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
 
No.
	What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
 
That was the right thing to do.
	No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
 
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
	Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
 
But Dad-
	Now! 
 
Now! 
	All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 
 
Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!
	What?
 
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
	So what happened?
 
All right, it was good. But we don't want "good," we want pain!
	Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.
 
Yeah?
	Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.
 
Oooooo!
	Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.
 
Oh, it's on!
	No, no, no, it's not on.
 
Whoo, it's on all right!
	It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
 
It's on!
	I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. 
 
Oooo, he is gettin' served! 
	Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.
 
Oh Lord...
	His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.
 
I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
	Stan? Stan?
 
Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.
	Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
 
Okay, good.
	But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 
 
You did it!
	You did it, son! You did it!
 
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
	Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
 
Kentucky, yeah.
	I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
 
I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.
	....Yeeeah.
 
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
	Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
 
Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
	Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!
 
Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party. 
	Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!
 
Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.  Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. 
	Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 
 
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
	We know, Stanley. We've been watching.
 
Who is that?
	That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
 
What?!
	Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
 
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
	They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
 
I wanted my job!
	Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
 
People from the future. Right, got it.
	All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
 
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
	Stan Marsh!
 
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
	Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
 
You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-
	Hey, Mr. Nelson.
 
Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here.
	Why? This is my office.
 
Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooo, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced.
	What?
 
Gheglo.
	You can't be serious.
 
I'm... sssorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room. 
	Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
 
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out.  Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another.  These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
	We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
 
Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
	All we can do is try, Harrison.
 
Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.
	Well what are we waiting for?
 
Back in the pile everyone!
	We're going back to the pile.
 
...What did you say?
	Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
 
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
	You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
 
Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
	You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
 
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
	You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
 
It's sexist, is what it is!
	You don't understand the issues, Sharon!
 
Are you calling me ignorant?!
	You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
 
We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
	Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
 
Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
	Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
 
No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.
	Expulsion?!
 
Oh, Randy!
	Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! 
 
No, Justacious, let him go. He won't survive a fore-night in the wilderness. 
	This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
 
Dad, isn't this a little extreme?
	Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
 
M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.
	So who won, Mr. Mackey?
 
Uh hey, wait a minute! 
	Stan!
 
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
	He's going to vote!
 
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
	Hey! That's not true, Stan.
 
You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
	Your vote still mattered.
 
Hooray! All right!
	Now your vote didn't matter.
 
People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! 
	Look at it, honey. It's so big.
 
I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change...  Now, shop friends. Shop! 
	It's beautiful!
 
Fools. Ignorant fools.
	Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. 
 
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
	It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
 
Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight...
	Aaaah!  Yeaaah... &lt;/&gt;
 
Randy, what are you doing?!
	Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
 
It's almost midnight.
	Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 
 
Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!
	Staaaan? 
 
Dad, oh my God!
	Staan...
 
What? D-dad, are are you dying?
	No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
 
But you-your face!
	Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 
 
Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
	We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
 
Aah!  I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right?  Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun.  Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? 
	Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
 
Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
	Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
 
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
	I know, I know! God!  Bleeeh! 
 
Oh, you stupid turd!
	Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
 
We do?
	Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
 
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
	Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
 
Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
	Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
 
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
	Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
 
Well what are you doing here, Randy?
	I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
 
Dad!
	Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.
 
It's like some mystical evil force.
	Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
 
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
	Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. 
 
We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
	Can I help you? 
 
Dad, what are you doing?!
	You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
 
Dad, you're a geologist!
	I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
 
We've gotta find the television department. 
	Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.
 
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
	Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
 
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
	Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!
 
What?!
	Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
 
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
	Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 
 
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
	The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
 
Come on, Dad!
	I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
 
No, dad! We need your keys!
	This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! 
 
H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!
	Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
 
We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! 
	Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
 
Duh.
	You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
 
...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.
	All right, let's not make that mistake again.
 
Back off! None of you losers are enough for me!  Eeeaaagh. Oh yeah. Aaaargh.  Tada! 
	Oh, no she di'int. 
 
Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it!
	Believe what?
 
Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
	What are you talking about?
 
Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. 
	Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?
 
He went with his friends to that music festival.
	Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
 
Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.
	Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.
 
...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
	S-stan. STAAAN!
 
Steven, what do we do?
	Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 
 
Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!
	My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
 
Have some water laced with acid.
	Sta-ogh. Ugh! 
 
Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
	Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
 
Forget it. 
	Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
 
We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?
	We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 
 
Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
	It's yours.
 
All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
	My God...
 
Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
	I'm the... only scientist in town.
 
I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!
	You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
 
Primary engine running?
	Check.
 
Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
	Vehicle shell holding! 
 
Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?
	The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. 
 
It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
	Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
 
Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
	Which cord is it?
 
You're the scientist, jackass!
	I'm a geologist!
 
We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
	Nyugh!
 
Let's bail on this whole angry scene. 
	It's working!
 
What?
	It's, it's working!
 
Dad!
	Stan! 
 
Now batting for Conifer is little Allen Varcas. 
	Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
 
That was no strike! What the hell is wrong with you, ref?
	Good call, ref! Good call!
 
Come on, Allen! This pitcher throws like a girl!
	What'd you say?!
 
You heard me, asshole!
	You want me to kick your ass right here?! 
 
You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!
	Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?
 
You'd better shut up, asshole!
	I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
 
No... NOOO!!
	This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 
 
Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em! 
	Heeey!
 
Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.
	Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
 
Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs.
	Wha-what do you mean?
 
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
	I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
 
Yeah!
	Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!
 
Come on, Fort Collins! Let 'em have it! Yeah!
	Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 
 
And first up for Fort Collins is... Morgan Pratt.
	Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!
 
Steerike!
	Yeah!
 
That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
	Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!
 
What?!
	Walk to first! Woo!
 
Crud! 
	Fort Collins can't play!
 
Why don't you shut your mouth before I kick your ass!
	Come on, let's go! I'm right here!
 
Aw spit! 
	Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!
